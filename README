This set of scripts helps analyze and report log file changes, ignoring
things that are reasonably normal.

The first thing you should do is look in the lcc/ directory and remove the
.lcc, .macro, and .squish files for operating systems and applications that
aren't relevant for the machine's installation. Then look at lcc/local.macro
and fill in the relevant entries. Make sure that /etc/syslog.conf has an
entry like:
	*.*				/var/log/all
and that log rotation is setup for that. Note that SunOS' syslog *hates*
doing this, so play with it a bit.

Then run "./mon /var/log/all*" and start filling out lcc/local.lcc with
entries that are "normal" for the machine. I often also create an
eraseme.lcc to help temporarily separate the wheat from the chaff.

Once things seems reasonably calm, add an entry in cron like:
	0 0 * * *	/home/XXX/lc/lcd

Then monitor the messages once a day as they come in.
